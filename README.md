PROJECT 1 - MEDICAL INSURANCE PRICE PREDICTION(https://github.com/alinashaji/Alina-Portfolio/blob/main/insurance%20prediction.ipynb)
: 

Created a machine learning model for predicting the insurance price for the new customers by training the historical data.

Historical data set contains more than 1000's of unique entries

Did exploratory data analysis to establish correlation with inputs and target

 used one hot encoding, scaling numeric feature
 
 Used linear regression Algorithm for training the model 
 
 
 
 
 


 PROJECT 2 - WEATHER PREDICTION(https://github.com/alinashaji/Alina-Portfolio/blob/main/weather%20prediction.ipynb)

Commonwealth of Australia, Bureau of Meteorology has shared a historical dataset that contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.

Created a model to predict the value of the column "Rain tomorrow" using the input values such as Date Location, MinTemp, MaxTemp, Rainfall, Evaporation, Sunshine, WindGustDir, WindGustSpeed, WindDir9am, WindDir3pm, WindSpeed9am, WindSpeed3pm, Humidity9am, Humidity3pm, Pressure9am, Pressure3pm, Cloud9am, Cloud3pm, Temp9am, Temp3pm, RainToday.

Used One hot encoding, Imputing missing values, scaling numeric feature

Used Logistic regression algorithm for classification

created confusion matrix and obtained 85% accuracy for the model

PROJECT 3 - MNIST HANDWRITTEN DIGITS IMAGE CLASSIFICATION(https://github.com/alinashaji/Alina-Portfolio/blob/main/Deep_learning_image_classification.ipynb)

MNIST dataset contain 28px by 28px grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9

Created a model using pytorch and logistic regression

Used softmax for generating output as probability

used evaluation metrics "accuracy" and loss function "cross entropy"

Trained the model and evaluated model using a validation set

Tested the model by randomly selected examples
